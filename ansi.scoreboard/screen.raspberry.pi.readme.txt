1) Resolution - /boot/config.txt

In order to turn down the resolution we're going to run at 480p 
as that is approx 87 columns (VGA is 72 when I tested it).

hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=2

2) Screen time out - /etc/kbd/config

Now we need to stop the screen going blank. This is done by setting 
these options:

BLANK_TIME=0
POWERDOWN_TIME=0
